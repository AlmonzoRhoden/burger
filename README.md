<h2> Application descripition </h2>

a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express and a homemade ORM (yum!)

Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets you input the names of burgers you like to eat.

Whenever you submit a burger's name, the app will display the burger... waiting to be finished.

Each burger in the waiting area also has a Finish it! button. When the user clicks it, the burger will be eaten.
